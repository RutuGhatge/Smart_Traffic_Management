# Smart_Traffic_Management

Overview
This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Automated Traffic Control & Compliance (ATCC) system leveraging YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 for real-time vehicle monitoring. It includes additional features such as:

Helmet Detection
Triple Riding Detection
Accident Detection
Emergency Vehicle Detection
The system is developed using Flask and Python for the backend, while React.js is used for the frontend.

Features
ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition): Detects and extracts vehicle license plates using YOLOv8/YOLOv9 models.
ATCC (Automated Traffic Control & Compliance): Monitors traffic violations and ensures compliance with regulations.
Helmet Detection: Identifies riders without helmets on two-wheelers.
Triple Riding Detection: Detects cases where more than two riders are on a two-wheeler.
Accident Detection: Recognizes accident scenarios using deep learning models.
Emergency Vehicle Detection: Detects emergency vehicles and prioritizes them.
Technologies Used
